# OpenROAD Flow

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.openroad.tools/buildStatus/icon?job=OpenROAD-flow-scripts-Public%2Fpublic_tests_all%2Fmaster)](https://jenkins.openroad.tools/view/Public/job/OpenROAD-flow-scripts-Public/job/public_tests_all/job/master/)

OpenROAD Flow is a full RTL-to-GDS flow built entirely on open-source tools.
The project aims for automated, no-human-in-the-loop digital circuit design
with 24-hour turnaround time.
