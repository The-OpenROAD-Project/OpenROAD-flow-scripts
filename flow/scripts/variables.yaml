GENERATE_ARTIFACTS_ON_FAILURE:
  description: >
    For instance Bazel needs artifacts (.odb and .rpt files) on a failure to
    allow the user to save hours on re-running the failed step locally, but when
    working with a Makefile flow, it is more natural to fail the step and leave
    the user to manually inspect the logs and artifacts directly via the file
    system.
    Set to 1 to change the behavior to generate artifacts upon failure to e.g.
    do a global route. The exit code will still be non-zero on all other
    failures that aren't covered by the "useful to inspect the artifacts on
    failure" use-case.
    Example: just like detailed routing, a global route that fails with
    congestion, is not a build failure(as in exit code non-zero), it is a
    successful(as in zero exit code) global route that produce reports
    detailing the problem.
    Detailed route will not proceed, if there is global routing congestion
    This allows build systems, such as bazel, to create artifacts for global and
    detailed route, even if the operation had problems, without having know
    about the semantics between global and detailed route.
    Considering that global and detailed route can run for a long time and use a
    lot of memory, this allows inspecting results on a laptop for a build that
    ran on a server.

ROUTING_LAYER_ADJUSTMENT:

  description: >
    Adjusts routing layer capacities to manage congestion and
    improve detailed routing. High values ease detailed routing
    but risk excessive detours and long global routing times,
    while low values reduce global routing failure but can
    complicate detailed routing.
    The global routing running time normally reduces
    dramatically (entirely design specific, but going from hours to
    minutes has been observed) when the value is
    low (such as 0.10).
    Sometimes, global routing will succeed with lower values and
    fail with higher values. Exploring results with different
    values can help shed light on the problem. Start with
    a too low value, such as 0.10, and bisect
    to value that works by doing multiple global routing runs.
    As a last resort, `make global_route_issue` and using
    the tools/OpenROAD/etc/deltaDebug.py can be useful to debug
    global routing errors. If there is something specific that is
    impossible to route, such as a clock line over a macro, global
    routing will terminate with DRC errors routes that could
    have been routed were it not for the specific impossible routes.
    deltaDebug.py should weed out the possible routes and leave
    a minimal failing case that pinpoints the problem.

  default: 4096
  stages:
    - synth
SYNTH_MOCK_LARGE_MEMORIES:
  description: >
    Reduce Yosys inferred memories larger than SYNTH_MEMORY_MAX_BITS to 1 row.

    Yosys will generally infer memories from behavioral Verilog code, whether
    the memories are in standalone modules or instantiated within some
    larger module.

    fakeram and empty Verilog memories(blackboxes) of memories will not
    be inferred memories by Yosys and are therefore not affected by
    this variable.

    This is useful and convenient to separate the concern of instantiating
    and placing memories from investigating other issues with a design,
    though it comes at the expense of the increased accuracy that using
    realistic fakemem would provide.

    Memories with a single 1 row will of course have unrealistically good
    timing and area characteristics, but timing will still correctly terminate
    in a register.

    Large port memories, typically register files, will still have the
    retain a lot of the port logic that can be useful to investigate issues.

    This can be especially useful during development of designs where the
    behavioral model comes first and suitable memories are matched up
    when the design RTL is stable.

    A typical use case would be Chisel which will generate a behavioral model
    for a memories with the required clocks, ports, etc. in addition to a
    computer readable file with the specification of the memories that
    is used to
    [automatically](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Tools/Barstools.html/)
    match up suitable memory macros later in the flow.

    During an architectural screening study, a large range of memory
    configurations can be investigated quickly with this option,
    without getting bogged down in the concern of how to realize the
    memories in silicon for emphemral RTL configurations that exist
    only long enough to run through the ORFS flow to create a table

    List of modules to apply automatic retiming to. These modules must not get

    The main use case is to quickly identify if performance can be improved by

    Retiming will treat module ports like register endpoints/startpoints.
    The objective function of retiming isn't informed by SDC, even the clock
    period is ignored. As such, retiming will optimize for best delay
    at potentially high register number cost. Automatic retiming can produce
    suboptimal results as its timing model is crude and it doesn't find the
    optimal distribution of registers on long pipelines. See OR discussion #8080.

HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN:
  description: >
    Specifies a time margin for the slack when fixing hold violations.
    This option allows you to overfix or underfix (negative value, terminate
    retiming before 0 or positive slack).
    floorplan.tcl uses min of HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN and 0 (default hold slack margin).
    This avoids overrepair in floorplan for hold by default, but allows skipping
    hold repair using a negative HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN.
    Exiting timing repair early is useful in exploration where
    the .sdc has a fixed clock period at the design's target clock period and where
    HOLD/SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN is used to avoid overrepair (extremely long running
    times) when exploring different parameter settings.
    When an ideal clock is used, that is before CTS,
    a clock insertion delay of 0 is used in timing paths. This creates
    a mismatch between macros that have a .lib file from after CTS, when
    the clock is propagated. To mitigate this, OpenSTA will use subtract
    the clock insertion delay of macros when calculating timing with ideal
    clock. Provided that min_clock_tree_path
    and max_clock_tree_path are in the .lib file, which is the case for
    macros built with OpenROAD. This is less accurate than if OpenROAD had
    created a placeholder clock tree for timing estimation purposes
    prior to CTS.
    There will inevitably be inaccuracies in the timing calculation prior
    to CTS. Use a slack margin that is low enough, even negative, to
    avoid overrepair. Inaccuracies in the timing prior to CTS can also
    lead to underrepair, but there no obvious and simple way to avoid
    underrapir in these cases.
    Overrepair can lead to excessive runtimes in repair or too much buffering
    being added, which can present itself as congestion of hold cells or
    buffer cells.
    Another use of SETUP/HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN is design parameter exploration
    when trying to find the minimum clock period for a design.
    The SDC_FILE for a design can be quite complicated and instead of
    modifying the clock period in the SDC_FILE, which can be non-trivial,
    the clock period can be fixed at the target frequency and the
    SETUP/HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN can be swept to find a plausible
    current minimum clock period.
