GENERATE_ARTIFACTS_ON_FAILURE:
  description: >
    For instance Bazel needs artifacts (.odb and .rpt files) on a failure to
    allow the user to save hours on re-running the failed step locally, but
    when working with a Makefile flow, it is more natural to fail the step
    and leave the user to manually inspect the logs and artifacts directly via
    the file system.

    Set to 1 to change the behavior to generate artifacts upon failure to
    e.g. do a global route. The exit code will still be non-zero on all other
    failures that aren't covered by the "useful to inspect the artifacts on
    failure" use-case.

    Example: just like detailed routing, a global route that fails with congestion, is not
    a build failure(as in exit code non-zero), it is a successful(as in zero exit code)
    global route that produce reports detailing the problem.

    Detailed route will not proceed, if there is global routing congestion

    This allows build systems, such as bazel, to create artifacts for global
    and detailed route, even if the operation had problems, without having
    know about the semantics between global and detailed route.

    Considering that global and detailed route can run for a long time and
    use a lot of memory, this allows inspecting results on a laptop for
    a build that ran on a server.
