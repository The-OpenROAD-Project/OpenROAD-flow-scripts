# Modifications

- Use the default TinyConfig.
- Turn the IMem and DMem sizes down to minimum.
- Mapped some memory macros instead.
- Target RocketTile for synthesis, which is the actual processor (this avoids all the system bus overhead included in the top level).
- Added sdc timing constraints.
- Added LICENSE files from [here](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip).
