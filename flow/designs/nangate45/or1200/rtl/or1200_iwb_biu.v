////  To Do:                                                      ////
////   - if biu_cyc/stb are deasserted and wb_ack_i is asserted   ////
////   and this happens even before aborted_r is asssrted,        ////
////   wb_ack_i will be delivered even though transfer is         ////
////   internally considered already aborted. However most        ////
////   wb_ack_i are externally registered and delayed. Normally   ////
////   this shouldn't cause any problems.                         ////
