This is a test of hybrid rows.  In advanced finfet PDKs there may be
rows of different heights.  GF180 is not such a process but we use it
as a public proxy for one.  We use 9 and 7 track alternating rows to
simulate the placement challenges.

One problem with this approach is that the 9t cells have a wider power
stripe than the 7t cells.  A modified set of 9t cells are used instead
which have the power rails trimmed to not intefer with the 7t cells in
adjacent rows.  The update cells are in
adjusted-gf180mcu_5LM_1TM_9K_9t_sc.lef.  No modified gds or Liberty
files are have been generated as they aren't essential to the testing
goal.
