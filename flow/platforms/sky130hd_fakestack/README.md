# Summary
The SKY130HD library has a 5 layer metal stack. As a result, it is very difficult to Place and route designs that contain large number of hard macros. To enable the use of the library for research purposes, we have extended the layer stack to 9 metal layers. The only change is the tech lef and the OpenROAD config files to use the additional layers.
