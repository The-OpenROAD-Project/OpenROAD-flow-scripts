# Colab Quickstart

Notebook-based packaging offers three main benefits:
1. Colab is completely free to use and can be accessed from any web browser.
1. Colab notebooks can be easily shared with others, making it a great 
   tool for teams to collaborate and manage OpenROAD design runs. 
1. The notebook can easily be modified to be used for on-premise servers or 
   notebook-based cloud providers such as LambdaLabs/Paperspace. 

We provide two notebooks for a quickstart to OpenROAD-flow-scripts functionality 
as follows:

## OpenROAD-flow-scripts Automated RTL-GDSII Flow

The notebook for the automated flow for `gcd` design in `nangate45` technology node can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bfcvqOnbw8q7FmSONLw8q7-yBVvKsQot).

## AutoTuner Flow

The notebook for the OpenROAD-flow-scripts AutoTuner flow for `gcd` design in `sky130hd` technology node can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wye0osn34YVWPvTrfBTftjOfGOtF3ABe).
