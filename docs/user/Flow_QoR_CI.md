# OpenROAD QoR and CI Metrics

To track the performance of the OpenROAD tools, we have created two sources
of information, namely: the [QoR Dashboard](QoRDashboard.md) where we
describe the flow QoR metrics (e.g. timing, area, power, etc); and 
the [CI Metrics](Jenkins.md) with Jenkins where we cover metrics regarding
regression tests.
