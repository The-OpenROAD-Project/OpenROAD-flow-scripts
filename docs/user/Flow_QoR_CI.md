# OpenROAD QoR and CI Metrics

## OpenROAD Dashboard 

The [OpenROAD Dashboard](QoRDashboard.md) provides an easy way to explore 
Quality-of-Results (QoR) over time and describes flow-QoR metrics, such as timing, area, power, etc. 

## Jenkins CI

We use Jenkins as our continuous integration (CI) tool.
You may use it to find out metrics regarding regression tests.
See more about accessing and taking advantage of our CI [here](Jenkins.md).
