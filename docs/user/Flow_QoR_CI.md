# OpenROAD QoR and CI Metrics

## OpenROAD Dashboard 

The [OpenROAD Dashboard](QoRDashboard.md) provides an easy way to explore 
Quality-of-Results (QoR) over time and describes flow-QoR metrics, such as:
timing, area, power, and so on. 

## Jenkins CI

We use [Jenkins](Jenkins.md) as our continuous integration (CI) tool,
you may use it to find out metrics regarding regression tests.
