# Using Pre-built Binaries

## Install Klayout and Yosys
Please ensure the Klayout version (denoted with `klayoutVersion` variable) is consistent with the one used in [DependencyInstaller script](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/etc/DependencyInstaller.sh). 

Instructions for installing:
- [Klayout>=0.28.8](https://www.klayout.de/build.html)
- [Yosys>=0.21](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/blob/master/README.md#installation)

```{tip} Unfortunately KLayout maintainers do not provide Debian 10/11 compatible packages. You can follow the build-from-sources instruction (Version >=0.25) and Ubuntu 22 instructions [here](https://www.klayout.de/build.html#:~:text=Building%20KLayout%20on%20Linux%20(Version%20%3E%3D%200.25)). 
```

```

Export path variables accordingly.

```
# these variables are used in flow/Makefile. Do make sure the yosys path is sourced.
export OPENROAD_EXE=$(command -v openroad)
export YOSYS_CMD=$(shell command -v yosys)

# only if KLayout is built from source
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<klayout_location>/bin:$PATH" 

yosys -help
openroad -help
cd flow
