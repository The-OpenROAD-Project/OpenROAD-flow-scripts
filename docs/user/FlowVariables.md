# Environment Variables for the OpenROAD Flow Scripts


Environment variables are used in the OpenROAD flow to define various
platform, design and tool specific variables to allow finer control and
user overrides at various flow stages. These are defined in the
`config.mk` file located in the platform and design specific directories.


## Platform


These variables must be defined in the platform specific config file
located in the OpenROAD-flow-scripts directory of
`./flow/platforms/<PLATFORM>/config.mk`


Note: The variable `PLATFORM_DIR` is set by default based on the `PLATFORM`
variable. For OpenROAD Flow Scripts we have the following public platforms:


-   `sky130hd`
-   `sky130hs`
-   `nangate45`
-   `asap7`


## Platform Specific Environment Variables


The table below lists the complete set of variables used in each of the
public platforms supported by the OpenROAD flow.


Note:
-   = indicates default definition assigned by the tool
-   ?= indicates that the variable value may be reassigned with design `config.mk`
